# IMB_Mapper_NYC

Illicit massage businesses (IMBs) are, by definition, brothels masquerading as massage parlors. Typically, the women are from East Asia, with the majority coming from China and South Korea. There have been many instances of sex trafficking in IMBs. There are a few websites that promote IMBs, but the main one is a site called RubMaps. This is the site used in this project. 

This tool scrapes RubMaps and extracts the name, phone number, and address of each IMB. The name, phone number, and address are put into a .csv file, and a list of duplicate phone numbers and addresses are returned. Then, the addresses are geocoded and placed on a map.
